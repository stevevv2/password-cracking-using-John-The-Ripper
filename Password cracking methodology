During the hash cracking I chose to use the password.lst wordlist as it is suitable for education purposes as it contains common and weak passwords suitable for testing vulnerable systems.
It's a default /inbuilt wordlist for John the Ripper ,Other wordklists can be found through your own reseaarch on the web.
john --wordlist=/usr/share/john/password.lst --rules meta2hash.txt ## cracking command used .
