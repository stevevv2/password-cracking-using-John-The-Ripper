Passwords are still the most common used form of authentication ,and yet weak password are still the main point of compromise of computer systems and organization infrastructure .Understanding how passwords can be compromised is essential in defensive security ,strengthening defensive security measures and education on strong authentication practices.
In the exercise John the ripper was used to show how password hashes can be cracked and reveal passwords in an offline environment.John the ripper is a widely used tool in penetration testing to test the strength of password hashes by using techniques such as dictionary attacks ,rule-based mutations and brute force methods.
Rather than targeting interacting with live systems John the ripper operated on password hashes ,enabling security professionals to evaluate password hashes without interacting with live authentication services.
The demonstration was conducted in a controlled environment ,with 2 machines ,a kali operating system and a vulnerable metasploitable2 virtual machine.Access to the virtual machine thriugh the kali OS was achived through an open tcp prt running a vsftpd 2.3.4 service which was exploited using metasploitable.
After access to the root terminal I was able to access the password hashes and stored the im my machine for further examination and cracking.
