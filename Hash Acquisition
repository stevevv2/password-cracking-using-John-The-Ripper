The hashes were acquired through exploiting a vulnerability on metasploitable2 running a vsftpd 2.3.4
service that gave me root access using the msfconsole.
After Gaining root access I listed all the password hashes using cat /etc/shadow and stored them on my machine.
process:
search vsftpd ## search for matching modules
exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor ## Exploit the Required module and run after setting hosts
